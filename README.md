# AI Powered Early Cancer Detection System 

This capstone project involves the design, development, and evaluation of an AI-Powered Early Cancer Detection System. The system leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to assist medical professionals in identifying cancer at an early stage. Its primary function is to enhance diagnostic accuracy, mitigate human error, and facilitate timely treatment through the early recognition of cancerous patterns within diverse medical data.

The platform integrates deep learning models to process and analyze various medical imaging modalities, such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and histopathology images, identifying subtle abnormalities and tumor indicators that may not be readily apparent through manual examination. Beyond image analysis, the system incorporates patient history, laboratory results, and clinical parameters to generate comprehensive risk assessments and predictive insights. The AI model undergoes continuous refinement through training on extensive datasets, ensuring scalable and data-driven decision support for healthcare institutions and diagnostic centers. The project demonstrates the impactful application of artificial intelligence in healthcare, emphasizing its potential to improve early cancer screening, support clinical decision-making, and contribute to improved patient outcomes through timely intervention.
